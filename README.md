# TEI_WildfireSpread
Predictions of where a fire will spread in the upcoming day are essential to wildfire emergency response, leading to optimal allocation of resources and quick response to fire activity.

Our goal is to use the Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset to predict where wildfires will spread, identifying areas for optimal resource allocation and evacuation, hopefully saving lives.
